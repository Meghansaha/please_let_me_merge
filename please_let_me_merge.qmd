Driving.. So let me give an example<br> Last spring, I took a long road trip that I've done many times.<br> However, this time was different because it was the first time I was doing the drive with my teething baby and my well-meaning but slightly overbearing mother in tow. <br> For me, this scenario was similar to my experiences \***using git collaboratively...**

...felt like Git wanting to help me with my code, but actually creating more work for justified reasons.<br><br>
needless to say, I was Stressed on this road trip. I knew how to take care of my baby and drive, but I suddenly felt like I had to learn these things all over again.

And honestly, I felt the same with Git. To understand how to work collaboratively with Git, I realized I needed to have a better understanding of it, because that lack of knowledge **lead me to say things like...**

- ~Don't linger here~
- You can literally fling yourself into the void
- You can make something completely new
- doesn't have to be one or the other
- you can leave the conflict markers in (code wont work)

- Cycle thru the frags (the below notes come after - work/proc)<br>
- You can probably never completely avoid conflicts working w/ others<br>
- But you can lessen the frequency and severity of them<br>
- Unfortunately, I can only give the highlights of these important concepts<br>
- but, Links are active and use this QR code to go to this talk's repository<br>
- Even though I have to skim by these, I hope I can plant the seed -> inspire you/team to think critically<br>
- start w/ comms - 'Good Communication' can look like a lot of things<br>
- first think of talking to people<br>

Workflow
</span>

Be thoughtful <span class="highlight">before</span>, <span class="highlight">during</span>, and <span class="highlight">after</span> your coding sessions

  - <span class="highlight">Before</span> You Code:
    - Emergencies aren't real 🤷🏾
    - Check Git Environment
    - Check Branch Status and "Drift"
    - **ALWAYS** pull first before touching **ANYTHING**

:::{.notes}
- Think of workflow as three parts: what you should do before, during, after:
- First off, Don't be bullied into getting flustered for "emergencies"<br>
- I feel VERY strongly about this<br>
- Git Env: staged commits and/or stashes<br>
- branch status: that branches are ready to be pulled<br>
- branch drift: If you started a branch of master/main long time ago, chances of conflict increase - consider if easier to start anew.<br>
- Probably the best way to mitigate a lot of conflicts, pulling before doing anything!

    - Commit Often (with [repeated amends](https://happygitwithr.com/repeated-amend))
    - Push Thoughtfully but consider "Branch Drift" risk
    - Use [git stashes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash) when there's ✌🏾emergencies✌🏾

:::{.notes}
- working on large tasks<br>
- break it down and commit as often as you want, but use commits amendments<br>
- to keep your git history clean for yourself and others<br>
- and push only when it's at a good "enough" spot to merge in<br>
Branch drift risk: - don't let perfectionism hurt you, work may be good enough to be merged if documentted and annotated properly<br>
- Stashes are great for unfinished work that doesn't meet your team's workflow standards yet<br>

- Big way to avoid conflicts is to leave no trace when done (pushing commits and stashing unfinished work)<br>
- Before sending code to some else (review/work on), check it yourself and sleep on it if able, b/c<br>
- ensure your work is clear, reproducible, and documented, so anyone could pick it up, run it, and understand it<br><br>

::: {.notes}
Because, just like with parenting, travelling, and most difficult things in life, there's no tried and true method to success that anyone can just follow. You'll find plenty of resources explaining the basic concept of merge conflict resolution, but it's a tricky thing to teach because while most conflicts are simple, all of them require some type of contextual knowledge. The only reliable method to learning how to resolve merge conflicts is through preparation, practice, and exposure.<br>
