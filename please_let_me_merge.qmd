## Git is like Driving {#section-header background-image="images/git_driving.png" background-size="stretch"}

:::{.notes}
Driving.. So let me explain that.<br>
Last spring, I took a long road trip that I've done by myself and with my husband many times.<br>
However, this time was different because it was the first time doing the drive with my teething baby and my well-meaning but slightly overbearing mother in tow. <br>
For me, this scenario was similar to my experiences ***using git collaboratively...**

...felt like Git wanting to help with my code, but it actually creating more work for everyone but with justified reason.<br>
It goes without saying, I was Stressed on this trip. I knew how to take care of my baby and drive, but I suddenly felt like I had to learn these things all over again.

And honestly, I felt the same with Git. To understand how to work collaboratively with Git, I realized I needed to have a better understanding of it, because that lack of knowledge **lead me to say things like...**
