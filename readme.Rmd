# **Resources for Please Let Me Merge Before I Start Crying: And Other Things I've Said at The Git Terminal** <br>

## **About**

This repository contains supplemental resources and materials that coincide with the *"Please Let Me Merge Before I Start Crying: And Other Things I've Said At The Git Terminal"* talk at [Posit::conf(2024)](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1712003906159001eMTZ).

*"Please Let Me Merge"* is geared towards those who may feel comfortable working independently with Git but need some confidence when working collaboratively. Just like novice drivers can learn to confidently (and safely!) merge onto (seemingly) intimidating highways, those new to collaborating with Git can also conquer Git merges with some exposure and preparation.

This talk will go over:

-   Different ways R users can interact with Git

-   What Git merges and Git merge conflicts are

-   Real-life examples of Git merges

-   Advice on resolving Git merges

-   Suggestions for cleaner workflows to promote better Git merges

<br>

This repository serves as a resource for relevant supplemental materials for those seeking to learn more about improving their git workflows to reduce git merge conflicts.
