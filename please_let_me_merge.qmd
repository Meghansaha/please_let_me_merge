## Git is like Driving {.section-header background-image="images/git_driving.png" background-size="contain" background-color="#1a1a1a"}

::: notes
Driving.. So let me explain that.<br> Last spring, I took a long road trip that I've done by myself and with my husband many times.<br> However, this time was different because it was the first time doing the drive with my teething baby and my well-meaning but slightly overbearing mother in tow. <br> For me, this scenario was similar to my experiences \***using git collaboratively...**

## Git does so much on its own, and just wants to help, but can make the process hard sometimes {.section-header background-image="images/git_2.png" background-size="contain" background-color="#1a1a1a"}

...felt like Git wanting to help with my code, but it actually creating more work for everyone but with justified reason.<br> It goes without saying, I was Stressed on this trip. I knew how to take care of my baby and drive, but I suddenly felt like I had to learn these things all over again.

And honestly, I felt the same with Git. To understand how to work collaboratively with Git, I realized I needed to have a better understanding of it, because that lack of knowledge **lead me to say things like...**
